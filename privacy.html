        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: January 27, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Johannes Bay ("I," "me," or "my") respects your privacy and is committed to safeguarding your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, store, disclose, and protect your information when you access or use Franca, a voice-personalized language learning application, and related services (collectively, the "Services").</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly.</p>

        <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Voice Recordings and Voice Profile Data</h3>
        <p>To provide personalized speech synthesis, I collect voice recordings that you voluntarily provide during the enrollment process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enrollment Recordings:</strong> I collect 5-10 voice recordings (each approximately 5-15 seconds) when you opt into voice personalization. These recordings are used to create a unique voice profile that enables the app to generate speech in your voice.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Profile (Speaker Embedding):</strong> Your voice recordings are processed to create a mathematical representation called a "speaker embedding." This embedding captures the acoustic characteristics of your voice and is used to synthesize personalized audio.</li>
            <li><strong>Pronunciation Recordings:</strong> When you use the pronunciation practice feature, your spoken attempts are temporarily processed to evaluate your pronunciation accuracy. These recordings are used solely for real-time evaluation and are not permanently stored.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Voice enrollment is entirely optional. You may use the Services with system-generated voices without providing voice recordings.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Device Identifiers</h3>
        <p>I generate and store a unique device identifier on your device to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authenticate your device with the servers</li>
            <li>Associate your voice profile with your device</li>
            <li>Enable secure access to your personalized content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This identifier is stored securely in your device's Keychain and is not linked to any personal identity information.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Usage Data</h3>
        <p>I may collect non-personal usage information to improve the Services, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language preferences</li>
            <li>App performance metrics</li>
            <li>Error logs for debugging purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.4 User-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>When you use the custom text synthesis feature, the text you enter is transmitted to the servers for translation and speech synthesis. This text is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored.</p>

        <h2>2. How I Use Voice Data</h2>
        <p>I use your voice recordings and voice profile specifically to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Your Voice Profile:</strong> Process your enrollment recordings to generate a speaker embedding that captures your voice characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalized Speech Synthesis:</strong> Generate language learning audio content that sounds like your voice, helping you hear how phrases should sound in your own voice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>I do NOT:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell your voice data to third parties</li>
            <li>Use your voice to create content without your knowledge</li>
            <li>Share your voice profile with other users</li>
            <li>Use your voice for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
            <li>Train general-purpose AI models on your individual voice data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Voice Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Storage</h3>
        <p>Your voice recordings and voice profile are stored on secure servers. Data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using industry-standard encryption.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Retention Period</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enrollment Recordings:</strong> Retained for as long as your voice profile is active, enabling profile regeneration if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Profile (Speaker Embedding):</strong> Retained until you delete your profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Pronunciation Recordings:</strong> Processed in real-time and not permanently stored.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Security Measures</h3>
        <p>I employ technical and organizational measures to protect your voice data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest</li>
            <li>Secure server infrastructure with access controls</li>
            <li>Minimal data collection practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Rights and Controls</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Voice Profile Deletion</h3>
        <p>You may delete your voice profile at any time through the app's Settings menu. Deletion will:</p>

            <li>Delete your speaker embedding</li>
            <li>Remove all associated voice profile data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After deletion, the app will revert to using system-generated voices for speech synthesis.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Full Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>You may delete all your data through the app's Settings menu ("Reset App"), which removes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your voice profile and all recordings</li>
            <li>Your device registration</li>
            <li>All associated data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Data Export</h3>
        <p>Upon request, I can provide you with a copy of your stored data. Contact me at the email address below.</p>

        <h3>4.4 Consent Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>You may withdraw consent for voice data collection at any time by deleting your voice profile. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, nor do I knowingly collect voice recordings or other information from children. The voice cloning features require explicit consent and are intended for adult users. If I become aware that I have inadvertently collected data from a child, I will delete it promptly.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Services use third-party infrastructure providers for server hosting. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and maintain appropriate security measures.</p>
        <p>I do not share your voice data with third parties for their own purposes.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>I do not sell your personal information or voice data. I may share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With infrastructure vendors who assist in operating the Services, under strict confidentiality obligations</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or governmental authority</li>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> To protect the rights, property, or safety of users or others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>The servers are located in the United States. If you access the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>

        <h2>9. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>California residents have additional rights regarding their personal information:</p>

            <li>Right to delete personal information</li>
            <li>Right to opt-out of the sale of personal information (I do not sell personal information)</li>
            <li>Right to non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>

        </ul>
        <p>The legal basis for processing your voice data is your explicit consent, which you provide during the enrollment process.</p>

        <h2>11. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Franca does not use cookies or tracking technologies. I do not track your activity across other apps or websites.</p>

        <h2>12. Future Changes</h2>
        <p>I may add payment processing for premium features in the future. If payment processing is added, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect what payment information is collected and how it is handled. Any such changes will be communicated before implementation.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Material changes, particularly those affecting voice data, will be communicated through the app. Your continued use of the Services after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
